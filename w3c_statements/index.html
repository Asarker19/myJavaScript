    <title>JavaScript Statements</title>
</head>
<h2>JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.</h2>
<h3>The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.</h3>
<body>
    <p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <h3>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.</h3>
    <h3>Line Length: avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.</h3>
    <h3>Line Breaks: the best place to break it is after an operator</h3>
    <li> Example: <br>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = <br>
        "Hello Dolly!";
    </li>
    <h3> Code Block</h3>
    <li>JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.</li>
    <li>The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.</li>

<script>
    let x, y, z;  // Statement 1
    x = 5;        // Statement 2
    y = 6;        // Statement 3
    z = x + y;    // Statement 4
    
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "Example: The value of z is " + z + ".";
